# Codex Skill E2E Run: Research Blog

Run date: 2026-06-04
Host: Codex
Mode: agent-native semantic rewrite, no CLI or regex rewrite pass

## Scope

- Surface: blog introduction.
- Audience: readers who want a sober explanation of the writing problem.
- Goal: open with the tension, not fake urgency.
- Evidence policy: remove unsupported statistics and soften claims about hallucination prevention.

## Voice Profile

- Source: `sample.txt`
- Style: essay-like, skeptical of universal claims.
- Rhythm: problem first, then mechanism, then limitation.
- Constraint: no fake stats and no "revolutionary" framing.

## AI-pattern Audit

- Removed inflated framing: "today's rapidly evolving landscape", "more important than ever".
- Removed unsupported statistic: "increases reader trust by 87%".
- Replaced impossible claim: "eliminate hallucinations".
- Removed broad transformation language.

## Fact Decisions

| Claim | Decision | Evidence handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Combines voice profiling, AI-pattern cleanup, and lightweight fact-checking | Kept | Supported by `evidence.md` |
| Humanized copy increases reader trust by 87% | Removed | Evidence says no study provided |
| Fact-checking eliminates hallucinations | Softened | Evidence says it can reduce unsupported claims, not eliminate hallucinations |

## Final Rewrite

AI drafts often have two separate problems. They sound generic, and they can state facts with more confidence than the evidence supports.

This skill handles those problems separately. It uses a voice profile and an AI-pattern pass to make the draft sound less canned, then checks claim-like sentences against the evidence you provide.

That does not eliminate hallucinations. It gives the writer a clearer review step before publishing.

## Final Audit

- Removed the fake 87% statistic.
- Replaced hallucination elimination with a bounded review-step claim.
- Avoided "revolutionary" and universal publishing claims.
