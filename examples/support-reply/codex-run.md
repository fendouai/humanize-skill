# Codex Skill E2E Run: Support Reply

Run date: 2026-06-04
Host: Codex
Mode: agent-native semantic rewrite, no CLI or regex rewrite pass

## Scope

- Surface: support reply.
- Audience: user with a profile/export issue.
- Goal: be calm, useful, and accurate.
- Evidence policy: remove unsupported sync and absolute safety claims.

## Voice Profile

- Source: `sample.txt`
- Style: empathetic but precise.
- Rhythm: acknowledge the issue, separate known facts from next steps.
- Constraint: avoid generic apology padding and avoid overpromising.

## AI-pattern Audit

- Removed chatbot residue: "Great question!"
- Reduced generic apology.
- Replaced filler: "In order to".
- Removed unsupported absolute: "your data is always safe".
- Corrected unsupported product behavior: "synchronize your writing profile across every channel".

## Fact Decisions

| Claim | Decision | Evidence handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill does not sync writing profile across channels by itself | Kept | Supported by `evidence.md` |
| Uses user-selected text, files, exports, or authorized connectors for a run | Kept | Supported by `evidence.md` |
| Data is always safe | Removed | Evidence does not support an absolute guarantee |

## Final Rewrite

Thanks for the details. I can see why this is frustrating.

I am going to separate what I know from what I still need to check. The skill does not sync your writing profile across channels by itself. It uses the text, files, exports, or authorized connectors you choose for that run.

Try the rewrite again with the source sample you meant to use. If it still looks off, send the draft, the sample type, and any evidence the claims should follow. I will help narrow it down.

## Final Audit

- Removed absolute safety and automatic sync claims.
- Replaced unsupported reconnect-account instruction with a sample/evidence follow-up.
- Matched the sample's calm support rhythm.
